                    Stephanie Chitwood is a freelance Junior UX/UI designer looking to connect! She would like to specialize in creating fun and innovative designs that alleviate pain points and provide an enjoyable user experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stephanie enjoys how in depth the design process is, collecting and understanding the user and user data, to make sure the features that are offered are precisely what they want to see. Stephanie enjoys working in a group of individuals that communicate and collaborate to challenge their own design thoughts. She is a learner, quick on her feet and thrives in a fast paced, fun environment. 
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Although Steph started late in the game with her career, she is determined to be one of the best. When Steph isn’t designing you can usually find her enjoying an evening on the town with her friends or walking the beach looking for agates.

                        Conducting 1:1 interviews via Zoom using qualitative and quantitative questions. It's important to understand the users pain points and how you might be able to alleviate them.

                    <p>
                        Approaching user research with an open mind is key. I like to start by getting to know my user first, asking demographic questions, then moving into their thoughts and feeling about the redesign.
